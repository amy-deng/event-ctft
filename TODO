When learning a causal model, one
should, thus, require fewer examples to adapt as most
knowledge, that is, modules, can be reused without further
training.


 discovering 
causal relations means acquiring robust knowledge that
holds beyond the support of observed data distribution
and a set of training tasks, and it extends to situations
involving forms of reasoning.

 causality, with its focus on representing structural knowledge
about the data generating process that allows interventions
and changes, can contribute toward understanding and
resolving some limitations of current machine learning
methods

using different treatment.... auc might be higher
