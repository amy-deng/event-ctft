The complainant even if he or she is a victim or has lost money has to wait in queue to recover what belongs rightfully to him or her the bench said\\\\nWe believe one way to avoid this problem is to ensure wherever possible a fixed time may be given to the complainant and witness so they do not have to wait for whole day for their matter to be heard by the Magistrate or any court the bench said.\\\\nThe bench added Proper arrangements need to be made by the Case Management Committee at the trial court level to introduce such a system. In other countries such as the USA one hour each is given to each party no matter how big or small the claim. We believe that time has now come where the Bar Council of Maharashtra & Goa and also Bar Council of India voluntarily decide to take a cue and fix a specific time limit for completing the arguments of either side.\\\\nPublished by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.\"\n",
